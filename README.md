## Greetings
2nd repository since the first one faced trouble pushing commits. For now this repository consists of auth module and APIS and a general interface for all our features. <br />

Install node modules
```bash
npm install
```
## To run client and server concurrently <br />
```bash
npm run dev
```

## To connect to cloudinary <br />
go to https://cloudinary.com/  <br />
Create an account and paste your credentials in .env file <br />

Thanks
